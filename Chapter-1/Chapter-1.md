# Chapter 1 | Neural Network Foundations with TensorFlow 2.0
This chapter introduced Deep Learning and showcased what is to come ahead in the later chapters.
We looked at Keras API, Brushed up on Neural Network Concepts like MLP, Activations, Normalization, Regularization, Dropout and more.

Playing around with MNIST Dataset, Ran the different models and [documented](mnist-benchmark.md) them well.
